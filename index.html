          <p>
            Even November 2022, i started this routine in my life with more
            dedication and consistence. Before that, i tryed other forms and i
            didn't right. Until now, i can do my goals everyday, even ON
            weekends. This routine DID ME more efficient and happier. For firt
            time, i feel like live my life with ENTHUSIASMER and i feel that do
            something in my life.

          <p>
            I get up ON WEEKLY AT 5:30am to prepare myself to go to the gym and to
            do about 1 hour of workout. When I finished my gym, I come back to
            my house and I prepare my coffe to my wiffe and stepsom. I try eat
            just health food to help my "good microbiota". After, i go to my
            job. When i arrive AT my house, I START my side projects LIKE I
            STUDY my college of Software Engineer(if I've task to do). If not, I
            go to do my course on EBAC about fullstack Python (about 40 min),
            after i study neuroscience behavioral (about 20 min) and I finish
            with study about nutrition, bodybuilding or culinary (about 15 min).
            After that, i did more 30 min of aerobic on bike. The rest of the
            day, I have time to my family, take care of my house and prepare
            foods or rest doing nothing (even). Almost forget, i reserve 30 min
            to read 3 books(10 min each).

          <p>
            On weekends, i try to rest and sleep. I SLEEP about 7h or 8h per
            day, even on week, also i usualy wake up 5:45am on weekends and I
            try do anything which involves cognitive efforts. I play game, watch
            something or organize something. I need to rest my brain to I have
            more breath to continue my projects. There are moments who I'm very
            tired, sick or something disturbing my day. Then, I try TO DO, at
            least, the minimum of my goals(based on book "Atomic Habits"). 
            I try never skip my days of my tasks to no break my habits 
            and commitment.
